# [Project 3: Airline Satisfaction Review](https://github.com/ChengpeiLIu/Pei_Portfolio/tree/main/Airline%20Passenger%20Satisfaction%20Prediction)
* Identified important variables using Feature Selection techniques such as Chi-Squared test, eli5 (scikit learn)
* Utilized Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forests to predict customer satisfaction level
* For Random Forests, it was the best performed model out of all 4, in terms of area under ROC and time taken for execution.
* 
Supporting $3.5 trillion (4.1%) of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP), the aviation industry has linked humanity together, allowing people across continents to meet and the global economy to function. Customer satisfaction is crucial for airline companies to build loyal customers and stay competitive. In this project, we try to identify areas of the airline travels that impact customer’s overall satisfaction and help airline companies provide better service as a way to increase higher customer retention rates, generate profits and stay competitive.

# [Project 5: E-Commerce Shipping On-Time Prediction](https://github.com/ChengpeiLIu/Pei_Portfolio/tree/main/E-Commerce%20On-time%20Delivery%20Prediction)
* Written in R, utilized KNN, Poisson Regression, Decision Tree 
* Predicted On-time Delivery
During COVID, business are forced to shut doors, so many customers start to shop online, these exponential increase placed a huge strain on shipping networks and increased competition among e-commerce sellers, whoever can beat the door and provide ensured on-time deliveries can stand out in this competition and hold a space in the market. We want use machine learning techniques to help them study their customers and build an accurate classifier to predict whether goods can arrive on time or not. From doing so, we hope to pinpoint areas where company can improve their services and stand out in the competition.

# [Project 6: Disney Park Improvement - Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ChengpeiLIu/Pei_Portfolio/tree/main/Disney%20Park%20Improvement)
* Utilized key word matching such as "Happiest Place on Earth" & "Fast Pass" and identify emotions and topics within customer's reviews
To compare customer sentiment regarding attractions at three Disneyland locations (Anaheim, Paris, and Hong Kong) using sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and n-gram associations. To identify keywords using topic modeling that can help Disney determine visitor pain points and improve park experience. 
* Recommendations: Many visitor pain points stem from frustration of waiting in line and crowds. A large amount of time is spent standing in line, which irritates people and contributes to a more negative experience. Another common pain point that contributes to the problem with long lines is park capacity — more visitors mean longer wait times for attractions and food. Disney should take steps to alleviate symptoms of a negative park experience.
